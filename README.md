# CS231n 2025 Lecture Notes

Unofficial lecture notes for **Stanford CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision** (2025, 10th Anniversary Edition).

The official [cs231n.github.io](https://cs231n.github.io/) notes are outdated and don't cover the 2025 curriculum. This project aims to fill that gap with modern, comprehensive materials.
